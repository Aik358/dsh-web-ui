# Agent Note: Maintenance run merges Skyrail Cabin skin and gates community-plugin evidence

Status: implemented

## Problem

The 2026-08-25 /pr-issue-maintenance run covered the open pull-request queue of zhu1090093659/dsh-web (the user instructed PRs only, with the default scope: pull requests explicitly assigned to zhu1090093659). Seven PRs were open; most were waiting on author updates against existing CHANGES_REQUESTED reviews. PRs #1118 (OUO Neko pet) and #1031 (dsh-miku-pet) were completed by the maintainer side and merged; PR #1098 got an evidence-based re-review reply. Community-plugin registration PRs are a standing review type that requires evidence on usage value, upstream stability, and compatibility with the plugin system.

## Decision

- PR #1087 (Skyrail Cabin skin) passed its gates and merged (squash, merge commit 42def344). The owner review had already approved; this run approved the pending CI and agent-notes-guard workflow runs on the final head (3d700112), re-ran the gate set locally on a head rebased onto origin/dev (frozen-lockfile install, full typecheck, full test suite with skin-center 552/552 and dsh-web-all 6/6, dsh-skin validate future-window PASS v1.4.3, skin-center/market/gallery/aggregate/docs checks all green), then squash-merged. All four required checks (CI checks, plugin-mount, guard-agent-notes, Validate PR contribution evidence) are success on the merged head.
- PR #1098 (dsh-agent-plugins-market): re-review reply posted after verifying upstream evidence. Install confirmation now exists (InstallConfirmModal shows surface counts, version, executable warning; cancel sends no request; catalog.install() writes enabled after confirm), and npm 0.5.2 is released. The review decision stays CHANGES_REQUESTED because the decline/cancel regression test is absent, and the confirm dialog does not show the locked source commit while Windows and reproducible runtime evidence remain missing.
- PR #1118 (OUO Neko pet): completed on the maintainer side and merged (squash, 93ae86d3). Completion: THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md gained the OUO Neko entry with full MIT text (provenance anchored to the manifest author/license fields plus the PR author statement, since no public upstream repo exists); the head was rebased onto origin/dev; a real GUI evidence pass ran on an isolated scratch DSH instance (family tarballs from the completed branch, dsh web http://127.0.0.1:3091) proving the Pet settings selector lists OUO Neko, switching persists pet.id=ouo-neko and swaps the sprite atlas to /pet/ouo-neko/spritesheet.webp, two 700ms frames differ (animation runs), and the decoded atlas is 1536x2288 with all 16 look cells (rows 9-10) non-empty; evidence archived under docs/archive/ouo-neko-pr-1118/.
- PR #1031 (dsh-miku-pet): completed on the maintainer side and merged (squash, ef0cbe88): shared loopback fence on the /miku-pet/config PUT/DELETE routes plus route-level tests, character-rights boundary in NOTICE.md and README (Piapro Character License link; Crypton approval kept as an explicit redistributor verification item), real GUI evidence archived in docs/archive/miku-pet-pr-1031/, and data-dsh-part anchors matching the semantic-attrs contract. Superseding record: [re-add dsh-miku-pet](../../../feature/2026-08-25-readd-dsh-miku-pet.md) (keep both, linked to the earlier removal note).
- PRs #1100, #1093, #1070: no comments posted. Existing changes-requested reviews stand; authors have not pushed or replied. Upstream dsh-fulltext-search has since shipped the security fix (server-side session cwd only, security-test.mjs, CI matrix, v0.1.1), but the PR evidence has not been updated. dsh-archive-button still uses the rejected host-serve string-patch architecture.

## Alternatives considered

- Re-review #1087 after approval: rejected because the post-approval commits only removed Agent Note files from the diff and regenerated market artifacts, and the local validation covered the final head against latest dev.
- Auto-close #1100 / #1093 / #1070 / #1118 / #1031: rejected because auto-close applies only to new-feature PRs with no maintainer reply; all of these carry an existing maintainer review.
- Merge #1098 on the author's reply: rejected because two review-mandated evidence items are still unverifiable.
- Review the open issues in this run: excluded by the user's explicit scope (PRs only).

## Consequences

dev now ships the Skyrail Cabin skin, the OUO Neko pet, and dsh-miku-pet (squash-merged 42def344, 93ae86d3, ef0cbe88); the Skin Center client gained the data-dsh-part="new-session" contract and its semantic adapter coverage. The community plugin index remains unpublished for the four pending applications until author evidence lands. The skill default-scope configuration was corrected from the non-existent zhu1090093659/dsh-web-ui to zhu1090093659/dsh-web (user configuration, outside this repository).
